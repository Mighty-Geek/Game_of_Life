# Conway's Game of Life

## Introduction

**Game of life** is a logic class of **cellular automata**.

There are various real-life examples which show that complex structures can arise from simple ones, e.g. snowflake, pattern formation in animals and plants, fluid tubulence etc.

Game of life gives an idea of self-assembling materials and robots.

## About Conway's Game of Life

Game of Life was invented by a mathematician named John Conway while experimenting with a go board.
Each cell has 8 neighboring cells (including adjacent and diagonal cells). The following rules apply to generate the next generation of cells:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies due to under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies due to overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell by reproduction

Some interesting patterns include: breeders (Gosper glider gun, backrake etc.) which show rapid population growth, gemini which creates exact copy of itself.
